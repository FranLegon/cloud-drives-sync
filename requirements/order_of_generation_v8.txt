This sequence follows the "bottom-up, dependency-first" strategy, ensuring that when a file is about to be generated, the code for its dependencies has already been created.

Phase 1: Core Data Structures & Standalone Utilities
(These have no internal project dependencies)

internal/model/model.go
internal/logger/logger.go
internal/crypto/crypto.go

Phase 2: Configuration & Core Interfaces
(These depend only on Phase 1 files)

internal/config/config.go
internal/api/client.go

Phase 3: Data Persistence & Authentication
(These depend on previously defined models, configs, and interfaces)

internal/database/database.go
internal/auth/token.go
internal/auth/oauth.go

Phase 4: Concrete API Client Implementations
(These implement the CloudClient interface from Phase 2)

internal/google/client.go
internal/microsoft/client.go

Phase 5: High-Level Business Logic
(This orchestrates all the internal components)

internal/task/task_runner.go

Phase 6: Command-Line Interface (CLI) Commands
(These are the user-facing entry points that call the task runner)

cmd/root.go
cmd/init.go
cmd/addAccount.go
cmd/getMetadata.go
cmd/checkTokens.go
cmd/shareWithMain.go
cmd/checkForDuplicates.go
cmd/removeDuplicates.go
cmd/syncProviders.go
cmd/balanceStorage.go
cmd/freeMain.go

Phase 7: Final Project Assembly
(The final files to complete the project)

go.mod
main.go
